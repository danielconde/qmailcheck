<p>Qmail and Postfix Mail Queue Monitor Script</p>

<p>This scripts will help you fighting against the spam. It will notify you when a limit of mails are queued in the mail queue of the server. Main Benefits are:
路 Detect &amp; Reduce the amount of outbound spam before being blacklisted.
路 Maintain IP good reputation in Internet blocking lists and networks.
路 Costs savings: Decrease the costs associated with the resolution of blocked IPs and staff workload assignment.
路 Improve Customers Engadgement for dissatisfied customer management for being blocked by other blacklists or ISP providers</p>

<p>== INSTALLATION ==</p>

<p>1) Copy this three files anywhere in you server in the same directory. ie. /root/monitor</p>

<ul>
<li>monitormail.sh: Checks the mail queue and sends an email if the queue limit "qlimit_remote" variable is exceeded. </li>
<li>script_flag.sh: Checks which IP has been flagged (0,1) to avoid sending notifications every time monitormail.sh checks the server mail queue. Acts as notification delay.</li>
<li>servers.txt: list of servers to be monitorized. 0 means not flagged. 1 means flagged = email notification already sent to email address specified by "notifyemail" in monitor.sh</li>
</ul><p>2) chmod 755 monitormail.sh</p>

<p>3) Configure cron job for:
monitormail.sh will check your servers mail every X minutes (defined by your cron job)
script_flag.sh will reset to not flagged (0) every IP listed in servers.txt</p>

<p>Example:
Check every 5 minutes servers' mail queue and flush notify flag every 45 mins. If a server has lots of spam, only one email notification will be sent every 45 minutes.</p>

<p>*/5 * * * * root /root/monitor/monitormail.sh
*/45 * * * * root /root/monitor/script_flag.sh</p>

<p>==ADDING another IP ==</p>

<p>1) Enter the key "IP:0" in /root/monitor/servers.txt at the very end, one per line. ie -&gt; "127.0.0.1:0"</p>

<p>2) Insert the RSA key on the target server to which the monitor connects directly via ssh. To do this copy the contents of id_rsa.pub where monitormail.sh is installed and add it at the end of the file /root/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote mailserver we want to monitor. Create .ssh directory and authorized_keys file if does not exist. Google it about creating the id_rsa.pub file on your server.</p>

<p>CAUTION! There can be no spaces or gaps by copying and pasting the content, otherwise it will not allow direct ssh access to the server.</p>

<p>3) If you are using Plesk Control Panel, check out the version. Plesk 8.2 and below must be added as exception in the next step because the binary mailqueuemng does not work.</p>

<p>3.1) If you have plesk 8.0 or 8.2, you must uncomment LINE 35 and add the IP. You must also install qmHandle in the monitor server.</p>

<p>Uncomment LINE 35 -&gt; # if [ "$line" = "YOUR_IP" ]  , if you need to add more than one IP, add OR operator and the bash code in brackets:
 Here's an example:</p>

<p>[ "$ Line" = "127.0.0.1" ]; then</p>

<p>After adding a new IP would remain:</p>

<p>[ "$ Line" = "127.0.0.1" ] | | [ "$ line" = "NEWIP" ]; then</p>

<p>Easy, right!?</p>

<p>CAUTION! there must be a space after the end bracket.</p>

<p>4) Finally connect via the ssh directly with the target server. ie -&gt; ssh root@NEWIP and accept the fingerprint "yes".</p>

<p>We are done!</p>
